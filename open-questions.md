# Open questions

**Can I use my own infrastructure?**

When you deploy infrastructure through your portainer instance, you own that infrastructure. Currently, we partner with OVH, with more providers on the way. All infrastructure costs are paid directly to your provider with your own account or you go through portainer.cloud account.

**Can I pay with a bank account or wire?**

Currently, we only allow payment with a debit or credit card. If you have more advanced billing needs, please contact our support team.

**When am I charged?**

Youâ€™ll be charged at the end of the month after you place an order or whenever your order renews. Placing an order means selecting a portainer instance creation, an env creation or a k8s cluster creation your billing cycle.

**How long is a billing term?**

You will be charged at the end of the month.&#x20;

**If I delete an env, a k8s cluster or portainer instance, will I be invoiced for it?**

The max number of portainer, env or k8s within the month will be used as invoicing baseline.

**How do I upgrade my portainer instance?**

First of all the app.portainer.cloud will inform you that a newer version is available. You choose when to upgrade your portainer version, according to your business contraints. A single click is required, and around 30 seconds.
